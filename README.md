## Overview

This personal package is a place to the store functions and lookups that
I have created overtime and may find useful in the future. I started
creating it after reading a blog from [Jumping
Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/) which encouraged spending time
putting your personal library of code in one place within a package.

Writing packages along with their documentation have become easier with
the production of a number of packages from
[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), including **devtools**, **usethis** and
**pkgdown** and I have used these packages in developing this personal
package. A summary of the use of functions within these packages is
provided in **Create and update a package** document in the information
section.
