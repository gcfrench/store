## Overview

This personal package is a place to the store functions and lookups that I have 
created overtime and may find useful in the future. I started creating it after reading 
a blog [Writing a Personal R Package](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/personal-r-package/) 
from [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/) which encouraged spending time 
putting your personal library of code in one place within a package.

Writing packages along with their documentation have become easier with the production 
of a number of packages from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), including [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/), [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) and I have used these packages in developing this 
personal package. A summary of the use of functions within these packages is provided in
**Create and update a package** document in the information section.
