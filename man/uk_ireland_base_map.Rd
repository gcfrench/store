\description{
A simple features data frame of the British and Irish coastline
derived from the Oil and Gas Authority's OGA and Lloyd's Register
SNS Regional Geological Maps (Open Source) layer.

UKIrelandIoM_DECC_OSGB36 This dataset contains generalised boundaries for the
four countries of the UK, the Isle of Man, and Ireland. The dataset is suitable
as a reference for simple background mapping, and is re-usable under the Open
Government Licence v3.

This boundary dataset was created from a subset of the DECC_OFF_Coastline_ED50
layer published by the Oil & Gas Authority in the following data package:

OGA and Lloyd's Register SNS Regional Geological Maps (Open Source)
http://data-ogauthority.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets?q=OGA+and+Lloyd\%27s+Register+SNS+Regional+Geological+Maps&sort_by=relevanc

The data has been converted from ED50 to OSGB36 and numerous individual polygons
have been merged to create a set of polygons for each of Scotland, England, Wales,
Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Ireland.
