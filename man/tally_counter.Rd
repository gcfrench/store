\title{Count the number of remaining interations}
\usage{
tally_counter(data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame to be used in the iteration}

\item{...}{character string argument named type indicating type of counter to use,
either adding or subtracting counts}
}
\value{
the data frame is returned so that the function is pipe friendly
}
\description{
The main goal of the tally_counter is to provide a quick and easy way to monitor
progress whilst iterating through a data frame, applying a function to each row
at a time. This can be useful when the time taken for this step is sufficiently
long enough to run the script in the background, coming back to the console at
regular intervals to check the progress. To help with monitoring this progress,
the number of rows remaining can be displayed in the console so that you can see
at a glance how far the script has progressed and how far there is left to go.

The counter is initiated by passing the data frame into this tally_counter function.
This can be done within a pipeline containing the iteration step, for example in
conjunction with the tidyverse suite of packages. It is used in conjunction with
the click function which updates the counter, either decreasing or increasing
the count by one. This up-to-date count can then be displayed in the console.

On initiation the counter is set to the count to the number of rows to be iterated
through, counting downwards to zero during the iteration step. This behaviour can be
changed through the type argument so that instead of counting downwards the counter
counts upwards from zero to the total number of iterations.

The number of digits displayed by the counter is set to four to mimic the appearance
of a real tally counter. However this number of digits is not fixed and will increase
to accommodate increasing number of iterations, so for example above 9,999 iterations
the number of digits increases to five, above 99,999 iterations six digits will be
displayed and so on.

# Use default decreasing count setting
iris_three<- iris[1:3, ]
tally_counter(iris_three)

# Set increasing count setting
iris_three <- iris[1:3, ]
tally_counter(iris_three, type = "add")
