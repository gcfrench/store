}
\arguments{
\item{grid_reference}{character, British or Irish grid reference}

This function returns the grid reference's northing in metres.
It uses the gridCoords function in the archived \href{https://github.com/ropensci-archive/rnbn/issues/37}{rnbn} package.

It can check either British or Irish grid references up to 10 figure (1m precision),
including tetrads (2000m precision)
