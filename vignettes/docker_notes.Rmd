These notes were made whilst going through Microsoft's [Build a containerized web application with Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-containers/) workshop, as well other online resources relevant to R. These additional resources were

-   Colin Fay's [An introduction to Docker for R Users](https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/).

Online resources for Docker include

-   [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) - required for running Docker containers locally.
-   [The Rocker Project](https://www.rocker-project.org/) - Docker Containers for the R Enviroment.

Online resources for publishing Docker images and containers

-   [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) - public repository for Docker images.

-   [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/azure-portal/) - private repository for Docker images stored in [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-registry/) and containers ran in [Azure Container Instance Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-instances/).
