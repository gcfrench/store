Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Graham",
           family = "French",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: This package stores the commonly used
    functions and lookups, along with function tests and documentation.
    These can be then used when creating new packages by copy and pasting
    the relevant R scripts and associated test scripts into the new
    package, as well as updating the pkgdown file.
