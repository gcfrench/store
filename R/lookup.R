#' UKIrelandIoM_DECC_OSGB36 This dataset contains generalised boundaries for the
#' four countries of the UK, the Isle of Man, and Ireland. The dataset is suitable
#' as a reference for simple background mapping, and is re-usable under the Open
#' Government Licence v3.
#'
#' This boundary dataset was created from a subset of the DECC_OFF_Coastline_ED50
#' layer published by the Oil & Gas Authority in the following data package:

#'
#' The data has been converted from ED50 to OSGB36 and numerous individual polygons
#' have been merged to create a set of polygons for each of Scotland, England, Wales,
#' Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Ireland.
